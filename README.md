A content-based Movie Recommendation System built using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and machine learning techniques. The system recommends similar movies based on features such as overview, genres, keywords, cast, and crew.

The dataset is processed by combining multiple features into a single text vector.
Using TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity, the system finds and recommends movies similar to the one selected by the user.
